# PROJECT â€“ PART 1 - ANALYSIS

### Due Date: 11 April Tuesday 23:00

The objective of the first part of the project is to analyze a game following object-oriented principles. You are expected to write an analysis report in the form of a markdown document.

Your analysis report is expected to include:

- Proper title info with a list of group members and the name of the game
- A Contents Page
- A brief detailed description of the game
- Class diagram drawn using draw.io
  - Explanation of the classes and relations among them.
  - Do not forget to include relation cardinalities, directions, and roles.
  - You must use association, aggregation and Inheritance relations; you can use composition but not necessary
- Use-case diagram drawn using draw.io
  - Detailed explanation of the use-cases.

You markdown document is expected to be a complete report, including the diagrams.

You are also expected to provide a code consisting of only declarations of classes (with necessary inheritance relationships) according to class diagrams you created. Your code and class diagrams should be consistent in all aspects. You can enter pass statements under classes for now. Your code is not expected to perform anything, but it should be free of errors.

In your report, please use good English and spell-check before you submit. You should include references if you have any.
